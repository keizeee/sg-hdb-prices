# sg_hdb_prices
  
Securing a hdb flat is important to many Singaporeans especially those starting a family. While BTO flats do exist, they take time to be built, not to mention the luck factor involved. As such, some might choose to purchase resale flats instead. In this project, I decided to explore some of the factors that may affect the pricing of these resale flats and build a model to predict these prices.   
  
A further extension to this project can involve bringing in more factors such as proximity to public transport and proximity to ammenities.
